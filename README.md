# Grass Phenology

<h2> DATA </h2>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/bnetobradley/grassphenology">This github repository</a> contains the raw data and code used to explore the phylogenetic structure of phenology in grass species.</h3>

<h4> In the /data folder of this repository, there are raw data files, these data correspond to specimens housed at the UBC Herbarium, and climate data derived from these. All specimens were scored for phenology (here defined as the presence of anthers), using the aid of a disecting microscope, between September 2017 and March 2018. Climate data was downloaded in March 2018. </h4>
